# So, you want to help?
That's awesome, but please keep these things in mind.

### Submitting Issues
When submitting an issue (like a bug report or feature request) try to use the provided templates as it makes evaluating problems, or adding new features with your information much easier. This repository has 2 issue templates, one for bugs, and another for feature requests. These templates are the same as the GitHub default ones so if you've written an issue using these before, it should be easy.

### Submitting Pull Requests
If you changed some code, and want to add it via a pull request, you need to give specific information to help me know if it is a valid, well-done addition. When writing a pull requests, please tell me: what you changed/fixed, why you changed/fixed it, and how you changed/fixed it. If you added a new feature, please let me know how it works (in basic terms, I don't need to know the whole workflow). If you changed something UI related, insert a screenshot if possible to show me what you did so I don't have to download and run it.

### Code of Conduct
If you wish to comment on anything (pull requests, issues, etc), be respectful of those you are commenting to. If you cause issues, or are rude and vulgar in the project community, you may be banned from contributing alltogether.
